# Multi-Location Weather Forecasting Application

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

This is an application to assess my understanding of programming concepts and demonstarte my abilities. The assignment is to build a small Multi-Location Weather Forecasting Application using the Ruby on Rails framework.

Build a simple application that allows a user to:

- Create multiple locations by (IP Address and/or text address)
  - ActiveRecord backed models
- View the 7-day forecast for each location
  - highlighting High and Low temps for each day

Bonus #1: Chart the highs/lows
Bonus #2: Leveraging Stimulus/Turbo for some of the CRUD interactions
Bonus #3: deploy the application to a PaaS such as Heroku, Render.com, or Fly (free)
